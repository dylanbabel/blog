I am a young, energetic professional seeking a creative and forward-thinking work environment. I aspire to work in teams with other like-minded professionals to craft innovative solutions. As an accounting major I have developed an indepth understanding of accounting standards like GAAP and ASPE. I plan to pursue my CPA designation with an accounting firm in Canada or the United States.

Outside of my major I enjoy learning about technology and it's applications in business. I see learning as something we do everyday, by keeping an open mind and asking questions. I look to those around me for inspiration and knowledge. During high school I used open source code to try and beet the instagram algorithm. Although this attempt failed. I had taught myself how to use python and chromium, to access my account and interact with other accounts.

While completing my education, I have contributed to two successful entrepreneurial companies. This has given me a chance to apply knowledge and skills learned in the classroom to real world situations. One of the companies I work with Mountain Fitness Training, the other being Cloud Nine Guides.

In my role at Mountain Fitness Training. I have had the oportunity to work on all aspects of the business. This includes accounting, marketing, and IT. I now maintain their website and accounting records. It is my responsibility to help monitor the financial health of the company and prepare tax returns.

I also enjoy spending time outdoors with family and friends. Some of the activities we enjoy together are; backcountry skiing, rock climbing, hiking, hunting and camping. These activities allow me to isolate myself from the rest of the world and consentrat on the task at hand. I use these experiences to teach myself how to best consentrat even when I'm not outdoors.

I have been fortunate to have travel to France, Portugal, Japan, Ecuador, Peru and Mexico. Through these travel experiences I learned valuable lessons about different cultures, economies and traditions. In my everyday life I try to bring in aspects of everything I learned from these travels. I look forward to traveling more in the future and learning about more cultures and nations.
