The following are events that have occured during the campaign or administration of Joe Biden that make me look at him as an unfit leader that could have in no way legitamitly achieved 80 million votes in his favor.

My thoughts are simple he claimed to support middle-class workers and the environment and has damaged both by cancelling the XL pipeline. Secondly he has already broken his own executive order about masking on federal lands. Not to mention his odd obsession with smelling people. Oh ya and then there is the clip of him saying and I quote.

> "I don't know what I'm signing."

He then continued to sign the executive order that he had no idea what it contained.

This is not an acceptable way to sign documents as the president of any organization much less a nation. I am also not very enthused by the total number of executive orders he has used instead of passing legislation through the house and senate.

Below I have put all of the official executive orders signed as of January 30th one of them is dated for February though. this list is everything from the federal records and their is more than one for each day of his presidency. However according to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/politics/biden-executive-orders-climate-health-care-coronavirus-immigration/index.html) there are 42 executice actions so I have no clue where the rest of them are. Not to mention that the [CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/politics/biden-executive-orders-climate-health-care-coronavirus-immigration/index.html) was last updated on the 29th of January 2021.
