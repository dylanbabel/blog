My thoughts are simple he claimed to support middle-class workers and the environment and has damaged both by cancelling the XL pipeline. Secondly he has already broken his own executive order about masking on federal lands. Not to mention his odd obsession with smelling people. Oh ya and then there is the clip of him saying and I quote.

> "I don't know what I'm signing."

This is not an acceptable way to sign documents as the president of any organization much less a nation. I am also not very enthused by the total number of executive orders he has used instead of passing legislation through the house and senate.
